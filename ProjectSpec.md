# 2017 Fall COMP3111/3111H Project LINE Chatbot 

In this project you are supposed to develop a chatbot on the LINE platform. There are three topics for you to choose. You and your fellow group-mates shall pick one of these topic and complete the project according to the time-frame. The same time-frame is applied to all topics. Shall there be any problem you should contact Kevin (kevinw@cse.ust.hk) for clarification.

## Group: 

Each group should consist of 5 students. Unless there is a strong reason and an approval from the teaching team, there should not be any group with less than 5 students or more than 5 students before Milestone 1.  To form a group you need to submit the list of group member (by 27/9/2017) together with the topic you choose from (by 29/9/2017) online. The link will be available on the course webpage later. Each student enrolled to the course must be in one group. No student can appear in more than one group. No group can include a student who is not enrolled in the course. Students does not sign up or groups with less than 5 people will be re-grouped by TAs.



## Time-frame:
* Wk 1 – 3: bootstrap: familiar with the platform and assigning groups
* Wk 4 – 5: planning/collecting user requirements
* Wk 6: Milestone 1 – Features Presentation
* Wk 9: Milestone 2 – Interim Review
* Wk 12: Milestone 3 - Submission of project
* Wk 12-13: <10 Minutes Powerpoint presentation of work

## Topics:
Your group should pick one of the following topics. You are not allowed to change the topic after submission. Each topic will be graded separately and therefore selecting any topic should have no statistical advantage. There is a requirement for H-group in each topic. These requirements may also optionally be implemented by non H-groups. A good implementation of these requirements is likely to receive a higher mark.

Please refer to [Project folder](./Project) for details information about each project.
