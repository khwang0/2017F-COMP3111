Proposed Rubrics

Milestone 1 (10%) | Meeting Record (4%) | Evidence of Meeting (1%) | Proposal of features (5%)
---|---|---|---
Complete |  Meeting record should log conversation between client/group member in a tidy format and should be able to summarize the important points in the meeting. (4%) | Has a photo or voice recording. (1%)  | Each requirement shall be addressing one of the business requirement or user's current problem. The list shall be shall explanatory. (5pts*
Not Good | Meeting record has log some conversation but it is unorganized. It is only able to point one or two important points in the meeting (2%) | - | Some requirements are written there but they are not very related to the business requirement or the user's current problem. (2.5%)
Incomplete | Meeting record is empty or it is unable to tell the content of the meeting. (0%) | Missing (0%) | Features are not enough (< 8) or the features are not functional level requirements (0pts*

Milestone 2 (20%) | Prototype (10%) | UML (5%) | Git Log (5%) 
---|---|---|---
Excellent | The prototype has demonstrated some technically challenging features which directly related to the business requirement. None of the feature hard coded. (10%)  | Correctly illustrate their architecture design in UML with appropriate tools.  (5%) | All team member has demostrated strong engagement in the git project. There are more than 5 _real_ pull requests made by each team member. (5%)
Good | The prototype has demostrated some technically challenging feature or creative features that does not appear in other groups and they are related to the business requirement. Some variables/parameters are hard-coded (8%). |  Correctly illustrate in UML with approprate tools while containing some mistakes (4%) | Majority of members have demonstrated engagement in the git project while one or two members are not very active (4%) 
Fair | The protocol has completed more than 50% of the features while some of these features are not related to the business requirement, or they are not technically challenging nor innovative. (4%) | The UML diagram is somehow able to illustrate the concept but it contains some mistakes (2%) | Only one or two team members are actively using git while the others are not participating. (2%)
Bad | The prototype has less than 50% of the proposed features or most of the features are simply hard-coded. (0%) |  The UML is poorly drawn and does not reflect their architecture design. (0%) | The team is not using git in team collaborate or git is only used as a local repository by individual. (0%)

Milestone 3 (40%) | Test Suites and Result (6%) |  Completion of Prototype (10%) | Fullfillment of extra Requirement (6%) | Architecture Design (10%) | Use of Project Management Software (3%) | Docuementation (5%)
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Excellent | Testing coverage above 70% (6%) | All features submitted in Milestone 1 are implemented. (10%) | Extra requirement is implemented and tested (6%) | Three or more design pattern are correctly used and demonstrate a good understanding of it. (10%) | All team members are actively using the project management software. (3%) | All classes/interfaces function are documented and correct format of Java doc is generated. There is a well written user guide / video to allow user to use it. (5%)
Good | Testing coverage above 60% (4%) | All features except One submitted in Milestone 1 are implemented (8%) | Extra requirement is implemented and but not tested (4%)  | One or two design patterns are correctly used and demostrate a good understanding of it. (8%) | Most of the team members are actively using the project management software (2%) | Most classes/interfaces function are documented and correct format of Java doc is generated. There is a user guide / video but it is not clear enough for user to use it by himself. (4%) 
Fair | Testing coverage above 50% (2%) | Two to three features submitted in Milestone 1 are NOT implemented (4%) | Extra requirement is attempted to implemented but not finished yet (2%) | Some design patterns are used but they are unable to demostrate a understanding of these pattern (6%) | Most team members are using the project management software but only limited functions of the software are used (1%) | Not all classes/interfaces are documented. The format of the java doc is not correct (e.g. missing parameters, return values) (2%) 
Bad | Testing coverage below 50% (0%) | More than three features submitted in Milestone 1 are NOT implemented (0%) | Not fulfilled (0%) | No design pattern is used and most of the code are written in one or two classes. (0%) | No evident can be seen that user are using a project management software (0%) | The documentation is missing or is at a low standard. No user guide / video is supplied. (0%)

----

Presentation (30%) | Technical Difficulty (8%) | Completeness (7%) | Application of Software Methodology in the Project Development (8%) |  Presentation (7%) 
---|---|---|---|---
Excellent | They are using edge cutting technologies or doing research on algorithm to optimize certain problems, which are related to the business requirement (8%) | The project is very complete. (7%) | The students are able to demostrate the exercise of many good practise in software engineering in their project. (8%) | Excellent presentation (7%)
Good | They are mastering some advanced technologies to address the business requirement (6%) | The project is complete while only some minor issues are left unhandled. (5%) | The students are somehow able to demostrate one or two good practise in software engineering in their project. (6%) | Good presentation / Slightly over run.(5%)
Fair | They are unable to use advanced technologies -- all technologies used are covered in the labs and tutorials. (4%) | The project is somehow completed and core features can be demostrated. (3%)| The students attempted to follow the software methodologies taught in class but not very successful.(4%) | Fair presentation / Severe over run. (3%)
Bad | They are failed to complete the project (0%) | The project is incompleted (0%) | No evident shows that software methodology is employed (0%) | Bad presentation / Absent. (0%)
